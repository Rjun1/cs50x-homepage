## Simple Homepage
### Description
This repository contains a simple homepage website created in 2023 as part of an assignment for the CS50x course offered by Harvard University. The project served as an opportunity to delve into the fundamentals of JavaScript, HTML, CSS, and the implementation of Bootstrap.
### Html preview
1. Preview HTML files directly on GitHub using HTML Preview: https://htmlpreview.github.io/. Enter the URL https://github.com/Rjun1/cs50x-homepage/blob/main/index.html and click the preview button.
2. Another method is to prepend the original GitHub URL with https://htmlpreview.github.io/?. For example: https://htmlpreview.github.io/?https://github.com/Rjun1/cs50x-homepage/blob/main/index.html.
#### Note
Html preview does not execute JavaScript code. Components that rely on JavaScript would not work in the preview.
